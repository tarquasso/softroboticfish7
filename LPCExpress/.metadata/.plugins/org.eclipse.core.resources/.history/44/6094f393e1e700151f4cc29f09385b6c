/**
 * Author: Joseph DelPreto
 * A class for sampling a signal and detecting whether certain frequencies are present 
 * Implements the Goertzel algorithm for tone detection
 *   Uses fixed-point arithmetic to a > 10x speedup over a floating-point implementation
 *   Uses Q15 number format
 *
 * Can easily configure the sampling frequency, the tones to detect, and the length of the buffer window
 * Can set a callback function to be called at the end of each buffer processing to see the relative powers of each target tone
 *   Make sure the callback function execution time, plus the time to process a buffer of samples, takes less time than it takes to acquire the buffer!
 *   You can check how long it takes to process a buffer of samples by enabling "timeProcess" below then using initProcessTimer() and getProcessTimes()
 * 
 * Debugging options such as LEDs to indicate status are also available
 * Can also choose to time each processing stage to ensure it is not taking longer the time needed to acquire the buffer of samples
 * Can also record samples and write them to a file (max 1000 will be recorded)
 * LED pattern if enabled:
 *   LED1 indicates tone detection in progress
 *   LED2 indicates at least two buffers have been filled
 *   LED3 turns on when processing starts and off when it finishes (so lower duty cycle is better)
 *   LED4 turns on when tone detection is stopped (and then other LEDs turn off)
 * Debug pins will go high/low in same pattern as described above for LEDs, but using pins p5-p8
 * 
 * Test mode can be enabled, in which case samples can be artificially generated instead of using the ADC
 *
 * Currently only set up for one instance of ToneDetector to be in operation
 *   Use the object toneDetector, declared in this file, for all of your tone detecting needs!
