// ===== INPUT/OUTPUT =====
// NOTE: To be silent (to not use usbSerial object at all), undefine printBufferSummary, streamAcousticControlLog, streamData, and streamSignalLevel
//       To stream the log info used in Fiji, just define streamAcousticControlLog - these are not human-readable streams
//       To view the data as it's being received/decoded, define streamData (or streamSignalLevel for signal level) - these are human-readable streams
//       To view a data summary (ex. number of buffers processed, words received, etc.) define printBufferSummary
#define defaultBaudUSB 921600 // 921600 for fish deployment (to be fast enough to keep up with data stream)
#define printBufferSummary    // print a summary of how many buffers were processed, the last computed tone powers, etc. once the controller is stopped
// SEE ALSO: streamAcousticControlLog, defined in ToneDetector.h

//#define artificialPowers // will use tone powers saved in a file rather than actually sampling (expects two tab-separated columns of powers in /local/powers.wp)
//#define singleDataStream // just read a single continuous stream of bits (as opposed to segmenting into words/decoding)

//#define saveData   // save data such as received words to an array, then save it to a file at the end - faster than printing continuously but worry about overflow
//#define streamData // stream data to the screen as it's received (controlled independently of saveData)
//#define streamSignalLevel // stream current signal level to the screen

// ===== EXECUTION =====
#define infiniteLoop          // if undefined, will stop after loopCount buffers are processed
#define loopCount 20000       // number of buffers to process before terminating the program (if infiniteLoop is not defined)
#define fishTimeoutAcoustic   // whether to reset the fish to neutral if an acoustic word hasn't been received in a while.  Not used with singleDataStream.
#define fishTimeoutAcousticWindow 5000000 // time between good words that cause a timeout (in microseconds)

//#define acousticControllerControlFish // whether to start fishController to control the servos and motor

#define useAGC        // if undefined, will only set agc (adjustable gain control of the acoustic input board) once at startup
//#define AGCLeds     // if defined, will light the mBed LEDs to indicate the chosen agc gain index (whether or not useAGC is on)
#define agcUpdateWindow 10000000 // how often to update the AGC gain (in microseconds)

#define dataRate 20 // data rate in bps.  Can be 20, 50, 77, or 100.  20 was used in Fiji. Above 50 may be less reliable.

//#define threshold1 // older algorithm for processing Goertzel buffers (not sure if it still works)
